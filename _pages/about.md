<!-- Qualifications

Strengths
======
* __Team worker__ - I am very understanding and co-operative when working in team and partner settings. I understand that sometimes things may come up and I may need to pick up some of their slack.
* __Patient__ - I am as well patient in team settings and other settings. I can help someone understand a problem or solution thoroughly and waiting for them to understand clearly no matter how long. I picked up this skill from tutoring peers in math during high school. 
* __Quick learner__ - I am quick to pickup any tasks or skills that come my way. Usually not leaving the topic until I have have a thorough knowledge of the topic at hand. 

Weaknesses
======
* __Initiative__ - Sometimes when I finish the task at hand. I struggle to find another item or job to do. However, when I am given a bunch of work or objectives to complete, I complete them to the end and then some. It is hard for me to find that initiative to start something completely new

More about me
======
Growing up I was always involved in computers and video games. Starting from when I was in middle school, I started to mod minecraft and tweak it, and even write scripts for Counter Strike: Global Offensive. This lead me to take coding classes in high school - which I excelled at and enjoyed immensely. Technology has always been an important part of my life. From something that helped me to grow as a person and get out of my shell to a tool that allows me to talk to my friends daily. Growing up as well I always wanted to make a difference, and knew technology was the way to go. I would love to work for a company who makes a positive impact in the world through their innovations. My end goal is to have a career and earn enough to then engage in philanthropy throughout the world and leave this Earth a better place than it was before.
